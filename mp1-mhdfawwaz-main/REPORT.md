## Summary and Reflection

In this assignment we were given 3 process types which are singleton, periodic, and stochastic for the queuing systems. Events are generated by each process type and added to a queue and then sorted by arrival time so they execute in the correct order. The optional verbose mode helps us to log the simulation progress so we can see the event flow. The report gives per process and overall simulation stats like total and average wait times. 


At first, I was finding difficulty in understanding an overall overview about the assignment. Then I started reading the README file and took sometime to understand with the help of GanttChart. Initially, I started reading the dart documents which helped me in completing the assignment. 

While doing this assignment, I enjoyed the challenge of designing a system that could handle multiple types of processes, each with their own behaviors and simulating them in an orderly fashion. Implementing the event queue and making they were processed in the right order was fun to solve, especially with the sorting by arrival time. For one of the yaml files, i was getting the different output, but then i found out that it was supposed to be generated random.

But managing the different process types was tough.I lacked information on these processes and I spent time on them studying the way they process.
